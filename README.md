### About Our Project
National Park Explorer is a web-based platform designed to help outdoor enthusiasts and casual travelers alike discover and plan trips to national parks in the United States. Leveraging user-centric design and comprehensive research, our tool personalizes travel suggestions, itineraries, and prepares you for an unforgettable adventure.

### User Research Summary
Our research involved engaging with potential users through interviews and surveys to understand their travel preferences, challenges, and expectations. We focused on two main personas: a tech-savvy professional with a passion for outdoor photography and an environmentally conscious undergraduate student.

**Key Insights:**
- **Personalization** is crucial. Users want recommendations tailored to their interests, such as photography spots or conservation activities.
- **Up-to-date information** on park conditions, crowd levels, and trails is highly valued.
- **Sustainability** and **conservation** are significant concerns, especially among younger users.
- Challenges include finding **affordable travel options** and **balancing exploration with environmental responsibility**.

### Storyboards
Our storyboards illustrate how National Park Explorer addresses users' needs through three levels of tasks:

1. **Discovering a Park:**  
   *Scenario:* Alex, a photography enthusiast, wants to find a national park with breathtaking views and fewer crowds.  
   *Solution:* Alex uses National Park Explorer to filter parks based on his photography interest and avoids peak times by checking the crowd calendar feature.

2. **Planning the Trip:**  
   *Scenario:* Jamie, an undergraduate studying environmental science, seeks to volunteer during her visit to a national park.  
   *Solution:* Jamie uses the platform to find parks offering volunteer programs and educational tours, creating a trip itinerary that aligns with her environmental studies.

3. **During the Visit:**  
   *Scenario:* Chris is in Yellowstone and wants to know the best spots for wildlife photography without straying into restricted areas.  
   *Solution:* Using the National Park Explorer mobile site, Chris accesses real-time updates and GPS-guided trails ensuring a safe and rewarding photography session.

These scenarios showcase the flexibility and depth of our platform, catering to diverse user interests from adventure and photography to conservation and education.
